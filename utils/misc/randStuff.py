  "If you fall behind, jump back in! If you missed breakfast and lunch, you don’t have to eat them before you can eat dinner. Eat with us now! Always start with today’s reading. The plan includes catch-up days because we understand real life!",
  "Theologically diverse, literally on the same page. Because our focus is so Word-centric, we can trust our differences to the Holy Spirit. We are free to simply encourage one another without worry. We are not teaching Scripture to one another, but rather sharing a love of Scripture with each other.",
  "Don’t let your perfect ideal be the enemy of a good habit. You can’t possibly get everything out of it – but don’t worry. You will be back! Because our goal is lifelong reading of the Word, you will have many more opportunities to understand that passage more.",
  "Our pace is fast, but not nearly as fast as you might think. Time yourself reading (just normal reading!) 2 Timothy. This is a four chapter book, and about the daily reading length for the summer. In all likelihood it will take you much less time than you expected! If you still don’t think you have the time, check your screen time!",
  "Nothing is for sale in the Bible Reading Challenge. This is a grassroots ministry of people who love the Word. You won’t need to buy anything, subscribe to anything, or charge your friends to join you!",
  "Our goal is habit formation, not a one-off perfect performance. We want to help you overcome those obstacles that have been keeping you from the Word.",
  "We want to see you succeed! We are all about helping you overcome those obstacles that have kept you from the Word. This is a down to earth, practical and realistic plan without any guilt. We want to encourage you to invite people to join you in reading and talking about the Word. This is not our secret food, but a world wide feast!",
  "Don't worry about falling behind, just keep in the word. This is habit building and good for your soul.",
  "It can get discouraging when things in scripture are difficult to understand. This challenge isn't nessessarily a bible study. It's good to dive deep, but it's also helpful to see from a birds eye perspective. Our pace is fast in order to get that perspective. You can always go back and slow down to get that closer view.",
  "Christ is the Word, we are to partake in Christ. How often do you eat? 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'",
  "Even if you can't get through the entire reading... start somewhere. If you fall behind, don't worry about catching up. If you fall too far behind you'll feel like you need to give up, simply hop back in with us and we'll stay on the same page. We will always be able to go back in the future and fill in those lost steps."
